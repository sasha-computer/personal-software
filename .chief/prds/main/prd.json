  "description": "A Python CLI tool (managed with uv) that searches for available domain names across all known TLDs. The tool has two modes: exact search (e.g., sasha.computer, sasha.dev) and domain hack search (where the TLD forms part of a word, e.g., a surname ending in .ck). It uses free protocols (DNS lookups and RDAP) requiring no API keys.",
